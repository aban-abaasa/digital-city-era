# 📱 Mobile Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Error: "Login timeout - Supabase not responding"

### ✅ Quick Fix (Try These First)

#### 1. Check Internet Connection
- [ ] WiFi or mobile data enabled?
- [ ] Check signal bars (at least 2-3 bars)
- [ ] Try switching WiFi to mobile data (or vice versa)
- [ ] Move closer to WiFi router if signal weak

#### 2. Wait for Retry
- The app now automatically retries login 2-3 times
- **Don't close the app!** Just wait...
- You'll see: "🔄 Connection slow, attempt 1/2..."
- This is normal on slow networks - just wait 30-60 seconds

#### 3. Clear Cache & Cookies
**iPhone (Safari):**
1. Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
2. Return to login page and try again

**Android (Chrome):**
1. Settings → Apps → Chrome → Storage → Clear Cache
2. Return to login page and try again

**Android (Firefox):**
1. Menu → Settings → Privacy → Delete browsing data
2. Select: Cache & Cookies, then Delete

#### 4. Try Again After 30 Seconds
- Sometimes servers need time to respond
- Wait a full 30 seconds before retrying
- Don't rapidly click the button multiple times

### 🔍 Detailed Troubleshooting

#### Still Getting Timeout After 60+ Seconds?

**Check 1: Verify Email Address**
- Make sure email is correct (case-sensitive sometimes)
- Example: `user@example.com` (lowercase is safer)
- No spaces before or after email

**Check 2: Verify Password**
- Passwords are CASE SENSITIVE
- Make sure Caps Lock is OFF
- Check for accidental spaces

**Check 3: Account Status**
- Did you complete your profile?
- Is your account pending admin approval?
- Your account might be temporarily disabled
- Contact admin if account seems locked

**Check 4: Supabase Service Status**
- Visit: https://status.supabase.com/
- If red icon = service down (not your internet)
- Wait for Supabase to recover (usually 5-15 minutes)

#### How to Tell If It's Your Internet vs Supabase

**Test Your Internet:**
1. Open Google.com or another website
2. If it loads → Your internet is fine (try step 3 below)
3. If it doesn't load → Fix your internet first

**Test Supabase:**
1. If other websites load fine
2. But login keeps timing out
3. Check: https://status.supabase.com/
4. Or contact support

### 📊 What to Expect (Timing)

| Network | Time | Expected |
|---------|------|----------|
| Fast WiFi | 5-15s | ✅ Works immediately |
| 4G LTE | 15-30s | ✅ Works (might show "slow") |
| 3G or poor signal | 30-60s | 🔄 Shows retry messages (still works) |
| Weak WiFi | 20-45s | ✅ Should still work |
| Offline | 45s timeout | ❌ Expected failure |

**Key Point**: If it takes 30-60 seconds but eventually works → this is NORMAL for your network!

### 🆘 Still Not Working?

**Last Resort: Hard Refresh**
- iPhone: Hold Reload button → "Empty Cache"
- Android: Hold Reload → "Reload"
- Or: Close app completely, reopen

**If Still Failing:**
1. Write down exact error message
2. Note the time and network type (WiFi/3G/4G)
3. Contact support with this info:
   - Email: your@email.com
   - What network: (WiFi/Mobile/3G/4G/LTE)
   - Error message: (copy exact message)
   - Did retry happen?: (yes/no)

### 💡 Pro Tips for Mobile Users

1. **Use WiFi When Possible**
   - WiFi is more stable than mobile data
   - Less prone to timeouts

2. **Log In at Night/Off-Peak**
   - Server load lower
   - Faster responses

3. **Close Other Apps**
   - Free up phone memory
   - Better network performance

4. **Disable VPN Temporarily**
   - VPN can slow connections
   - Try without VPN for login

5. **Update Your App/Browser**
   - Old app versions have bugs
   - Keep browser updated
